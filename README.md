An application is developed for QGIS 3.8.* to identify and provide aggregated traffic crash statistics around Greater Melbourneâ€™s shopping centres. Through a series of processes, the code utilises shopping centre locations and traffic accident data over the last 5 years, between 2014 and 2018.

Sample Datasets
* Locations of shopping centres (Property Council of Australia, 2017)
* Crashes last five years (Department of Transport Open Data, 2019)
* Suburbs in Australia (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2016)
* Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSA) (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2016)

Instructions:
* It is recommended that you update the filepath for the script to work.
* The script works via Python Console > Show Editor.
* Estimated time: 2-5 minutes.
